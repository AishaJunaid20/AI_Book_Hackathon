## Prompt Text
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Text
Successfully implemented all tasks for Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2). Created Docusaurus project in frontend/frontend directory, configured site with "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" title, created module-specific sidebar, and authored three chapters: Introduction to ROS 2, ROS 2 Communication Primitives, and Humanoid Representation with URDF. All content follows nervous system analogy and is accessible to target audience. Production build tested successfully.

## Outcome
All 35 tasks completed across 6 phases: Setup, Foundational Configuration, 3 user story phases for each chapter, and Integration and Polish. Docusaurus site successfully created with 3 educational chapters on ROS 2 concepts, properly structured with cross-references and navigation.

## Evaluation
All tasks from tasks.md completed successfully. Docusaurus project properly initialized with correct configuration. Three educational chapters created with appropriate content covering ROS 2 concepts using nervous system analogies. Site builds successfully with proper navigation and cross-references between chapters.
