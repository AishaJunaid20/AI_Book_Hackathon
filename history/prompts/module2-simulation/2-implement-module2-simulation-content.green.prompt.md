# Implement Module 2 Simulation Content

## Prompt Text
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Text
Successfully implemented Module 2: Simulation and Digital Twin Concepts for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. The implementation included:

1. Created the docs/module2-simulation directory structure
2. Implemented three comprehensive chapters:
   - Chapter 1: Simulation Fundamentals and Digital Twin Concepts
   - Chapter 2: Gazebo for Robotics Simulation
   - Chapter 3: Unity for Digital Twin Applications
3. Configured navigation in sidebars.js with Module 2 category
4. Updated main navigation in docusaurus.config.js to include Module 2 access
5. Added cross-references between all Module 2 chapters and connections to Module 1 concepts
6. Verified all content follows Docusaurus conventions with proper frontmatter

All 37 tasks from the tasks.md file have been completed and marked as [X]. The implementation follows the MVP-first approach with incremental delivery, and all content is accessible through the Docusaurus navigation system.

## Outcome
Module 2 content is now fully implemented and integrated into the Docusaurus documentation site. Students can access three comprehensive chapters covering simulation fundamentals, Gazebo for robotics simulation, and Unity for digital twin applications. The content connects well with Module 1's ROS 2 concepts and provides practical examples and use cases for each platform.
