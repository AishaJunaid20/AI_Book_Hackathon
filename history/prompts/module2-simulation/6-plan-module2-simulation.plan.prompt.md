## Prompt Text
```
Project: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics – Module 2
Goal: Teach simulation and digital twin concepts using Gazebo & Unity, structured into 3 chapters in Docusaurus
```

## Response Text
Created comprehensive plan for Module 2: Simulation and Digital Twin Concepts, including 3 chapters covering simulation fundamentals, Gazebo for robotics simulation, and Unity for digital twin applications. Plan includes detailed technical approach, implementation steps, and evaluation criteria.

## Outcome
Module 2 plan successfully created at specs/module2-simulation/plan.md with detailed structure for 3 chapters covering simulation concepts, Gazebo, and Unity integration in Docusaurus format.

## Evaluation
The plan addresses all requirements from the user prompt: simulation and digital twin concepts using Gazebo & Unity, structured into 3 chapters for Docusaurus. Includes comprehensive technical approach, implementation steps, and validation criteria.
