# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™) - Plan

## Technical Stack
- Docusaurus documentation framework
- Markdown format for content
- Git-based version control
- NVIDIA Isaac platform documentation references

## Project Structure
- `frontend/frontend/docs/module3-ai-robot-brain/` - Module content directory
- 3 chapters following Docusaurus format with frontmatter
- Integration with existing sidebar and navigation

## Implementation Approach

### Chapter 1: Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac Platform for Robotics
- Overview of NVIDIA Isaac platform and its components
- Isaac Sim for simulation and synthetic data generation
- Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated perception
- Integration with ROS 2 and hardware acceleration benefits
- Use cases in humanoid robotics

### Chapter 2: NVIDIA Isaac Sim for Advanced Robotics Simulation
- Isaac Sim architecture and core components
- Physics simulation and realistic environment creation
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, cameras, IMU, etc.)
- Synthetic data generation for perception training
- Integration with ROS 2 for simulation-to-reality transfer

### Chapter 3: Isaac ROS and Nav2 for Navigation
- Isaac ROS packages and perception capabilities
- Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM)
- Integration with Nav2 for path planning
- Bipedal path planning considerations
- Real-world deployment and transfer learning

## Libraries and Dependencies
- Docusaurus v3.x
- React components for documentation
- Standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## Risk Assessment
- Rapidly evolving NVIDIA Isaac technologies
- Complexity of advanced robotics concepts
- Need for accurate technical information
