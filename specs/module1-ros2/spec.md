# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Specification

## Purpose
Define and author Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course as three structured Docusaurus chapters, introducing ROS 2 as the foundational nervous system for humanoid robots.

## Target Audience
- AI & Robotics students with Python and basic AI background
- No prior ROS 2 experience assumed

## Module Scope
This module will cover the foundational concepts of ROS 2 as the nervous system for humanoid robots. The module will be structured as three Docusaurus chapters:

### Chapter 1: Introduction to ROS 2 as a Robotic Nervous System
- What ROS 2 is and why it exists
- Middleware role in physical AI systems
- ROS 2 vs traditional software architectures
- How nodes, topics, and services mimic a nervous system

### Chapter 2: ROS 2 Communication Primitives
- Nodes, Topics, Services, and basic data flow
- Message passing concepts (publish/subscribe)
- Real-time considerations and modularity
- Conceptual examples (no full implementation guide)

### Chapter 3: Humanoid Representation with URDF
- Purpose of URDF in humanoid robotics
- Links, joints, sensors, and actuators
- How URDF connects software control to physical bodies
- Role of URDF in simulation and real-world robots

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Three well-structured Docusaurus chapters created
- [ ] Content appropriate for target audience with no prior ROS 2 experience
- [ ] Clear explanations of ROS 2 concepts with analogies to nervous systems
- [ ] Proper integration with Docusaurus documentation framework
- [ ] All concepts explained without requiring implementation guides
- [ ] Content focuses on conceptual understanding rather than step-by-step tutorials

## Constraints
- Content must be conceptual, not implementation-focused
- No full implementation guides required
- Must be accessible to students without ROS 2 background
- Should use nervous system analogies to explain ROS 2 concepts
- Must integrate properly with Docusaurus framework

## Out of Scope
- Detailed ROS 2 installation procedures
- Complete implementation examples
- Hardware-specific configurations
- Advanced ROS 2 features beyond the core concepts
- ROS 1 comparisons (focus only on ROS 2)

## Dependencies
- Docusaurus documentation framework
- Basic Python knowledge assumed in target audience
- Basic AI background assumed in target audience

## Success Metrics
- Students understand ROS 2 as a middleware system
- Students can explain the nervous system analogy for ROS 2
- Students understand the purpose of URDF in humanoid robotics
- Content is well-received by target audience
- Proper integration with overall course structure
