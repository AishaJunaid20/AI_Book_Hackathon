# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Plan

## Technical Stack
- Docusaurus documentation framework
- Markdown format for content
- Git-based version control
- Vision-Language-Action system documentation references

## Project Structure
- `frontend/frontend/docs/module4-vla/` - Module content directory
- 3 chapters following Docusaurus format with frontmatter
- Integration with existing sidebar and navigation

## Implementation Approach

### Chapter 1: Introduction to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) in Robotics
- Definition and scope of Vision-Language-Action systems
- Role of LLMs in cognitive robotics
- Integration of vision systems with language understanding
- Action execution in robotic systems
- Historical context and evolution of cognitive robotics
- Key challenges and opportunities

### Chapter 2: Voice-to-Action Systems and LLM Integration
- Voice command processing pipeline (using OpenAI Whisper)
- Natural language understanding and intent recognition
- LLM-based task decomposition and planning
- Mapping language to robotic actions
- Natural language interfaces for robotics
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Chapter 3: Capstone - Complete VLA Implementation
- Integration of ROS 2, Simulation, and Isaac components
- End-to-end example of VLA system architecture
- Combining perception, planning, and action
- Autonomous humanoid system overview
- Real-world deployment considerations
- Future directions in cognitive robotics

## Libraries and Dependencies
- Docusaurus v3.x
- React components for documentation
- Standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## Risk Assessment
- Rapidly evolving LLM and VLA technologies
- Complexity of cognitive robotics concepts
- Need for accurate technical information
- Integration complexity across multiple modules
